        - Spring: March to May
        - Summer: June to August
        - Fall: September to Novemeber 
        - Winter: December to February
    - Get number of bookings, cancelled, non cancelled
2. Grouping the rows based on market segment
3. sum ( [AvgRoomPrice] * [BookingStatus = Canceled] ) = $$$ lost in cancelled reservation
4. Grouping rows based on room type
5.
